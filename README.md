## Getting Started
After inviting nanami to your server, type `n.help` to get a list of the latest commands.

## What can Nanami do?
Anything emoji related: She's got it. 
Nanami has three major areas of functionality:
- Emoji tracking
- Emoji augmentation
- Emoji management

### Emoji Tracking
Nanami reads all of your messages, and she tracks the use of every custom emoji. To view your emoji use data, simply type `n.view`.  
Nanami will retrieve data about your use of custom emoji and generate a bar-chart representing the data.

The `view` command is a very powerful command and can display emoji data on individual users, entire servers, specific emojis, and more. Type `n.info view` to read more about the features of the `view` command.

### Emoji Augmentation
Nanami allows anyone to easily use nitro-only emojis.  
When you use a nitro-only emoji, nanami will delete your message, and send an identical message on your behalf. Since Bots have nitro, the emoji will be displayed successfully.

Nanami allows you to send large-format emojis via the `big` command.

Another fun feature is the wildcard emoji `:?:`. Use `:?:` anywhere you would use an emoji, and nanami will replace the `:?:` with a random emoji.

### Emoji Management
Nanami knows you are bored of your server's emojis. Nanami lets you easily browse emojis by typing `n.list`.  
The list command displays all of the emojis nanami has access to. See one you like? Add it to your server instantly using the `add` command.

## Closing

Thank you for taking a look at my bot. Happy emoji-ing.
